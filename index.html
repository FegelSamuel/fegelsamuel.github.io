      <h2>About</h2>

      <p>
        Hello. I'm a student at the University of Texas at Dallas. My specializations are webdev,
        machine learning, Linux, and project management.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have experience with cloud deployments, product management, contracting, and have had two jobs
        where I teach computer science subjects to other UTD students.
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of technical skills, I don't think I am anything special. The real meat of my skill
        portfolio is how I work with people and my motivation to get things done. I'm only okay at
        programming, but I really enjoy it, so you can easily work me very hard and it will take a lot
        for me to start complaining, haha.
      </p>
