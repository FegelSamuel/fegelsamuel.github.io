  <p>Hello. I'm a student at the University of Texas at Dallas. My specializations are webdev, machine learning, Linux, and project management. </p>
  <p>I have experience with cloud deployments, product management, contracting, and have had two jobs where I teach computer science subjects to other UTD students.</p>
  <p>In terms of technical skills, I don't think I am anything special. The real meat of my skill portfolio is how I work with people and my motivation to get things done. I'm only okay at programming, but I really enjoy it, so you can easily work me very hard and it will take a lot for me to start complaining, haha. </p>
